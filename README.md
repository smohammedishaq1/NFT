## Features:

### ERC-721 Smart Contracts:

- Solidity smart contracts that adhere to the ERC-721 standard for NFTs.
- Minting, buying, selling, and transferring functionalities.

### MERN Stack:

- Backend server built with Node.js and Express.js.
- MongoDB database for storing user data, NFT metadata, and transaction history.
- React.js frontend for a dynamic and engaging user interface.

### Wallet Integration:

- Seamless integration with Ethereum wallets (MetaMask, etc.).
- Users can connect their wallets to buy, sell, and manage NFTs securely.

### Payment Options:

- Support for cryptocurrency transactions (ETH) within the platform.
- Integration with a payment gateway for a smooth and secure payment experience.

### User Authentication and Authorization:

- Secure account creation and login processes.
- Authorization rules to control access to specific features.

### Documentation:

- Comprehensive README.md with setup instructions for smart contracts, backend, and frontend.
- Project structure, key files, and deployment guidelines are well-documented.

### Testing:

- Thorough unit tests for smart contracts, backend, and frontend components.
- Ensures the security and reliability of the platform.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/LinuxKunaL/gigatrade-NFTs-Marketplace.git
    ```

2.  **Setup .env file:**

    ```
        REACT_APP_API_URL= 'backend url'

        REACT_APP_WEB3_PROVIDER=
        
        REACT_APP_ETH_CHAIN=sepolia
        
        REACT_APP_OPENSEA_URL=https://testnets.opensea.io
        
        REACT_APP_BLOCK_EXPLORE_URL=https://sepolia.etherscan.io
        
        REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
        
        REACT_APP_NFT_STORAGE_KEY=  #i'm useing https://nft.storage for ipfs storage
        
        REACT_APP_CONTRACT_OWNER_ADDRESS=0x0B113FB87c3d94CD27e026946b552845136b61e5
    
    ```

3.  **Set up a custom ERC721 file: I have modified a default ERC721 contract file, so you need to replace it with the one I will provide you in the 'contract' folder"**

    _Copy the file code and paste it into the original ERC721 file, which can be found in the 'node_module' folder at 'node_module/@openzipline/token/ERC721.' Locate 'ERC721.sol' and replace it with the file that I will provide.

4.  **Setup Backend:**

   Start in local
    ```
    npm run local
    ```

   Start in production level
    ```
    npm run prod
    ```
    
6.  **Setup Instructions:**

    Follow the guidelines in the README.md for setting up smart contracts, backend, and frontend.

7.  **Contribute:**

    Feel free to contribute by opening issues, submitting pull requests, or providing feedback.
